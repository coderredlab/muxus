## What it is

A desktop terminal client built around the session rather than the shell. Open a host to
get a terminal, then split it, drag a tab into the pane beside it, open the file browser,
edit a remote file in Monaco and start a tunnel. They all use the same connection, without
a second login. Save the arrangement as a workspace and reopen it tomorrow.

The terminal supports kitty graphics, so `kitten icat`, yazi previews and matplotlib render
inline over SSH. It also supports the kitty keyboard protocol, includes Nerd Font coverage
and comes with fifteen colour schemes.

Muxus reads every host from `~/.ssh/config`, while also letting you keep selected SSH hosts
in its local database without changing OpenSSH. Folders, colours, workspaces and history
use the same local database.

-   :material-file-cog-outline: **OpenSSH or Muxus-only**

    ---

    Every `Host` block appears in the sidebar, including files pulled in with `Include`.
    New and imported SSH hosts can instead stay entirely in Muxus app data.

    [:octicons-arrow-right-24: Your hosts](guide/hosts.md)

-   :material-image-outline: **Inline terminal images**

    ---

    The kitty graphics protocol renders `kitten icat`, yazi previews, matplotlib and timg
    inline, over SSH. Sixel and iTerm2 images work too.

    [:octicons-arrow-right-24: Images in the terminal](guide/graphics.md)

-   :material-view-split-vertical: **Split panes**

    ---

    ++ctrl+shift+left++ / ++ctrl+shift+right++ splits toward that side and reuses the
    connection. ++alt+left++ moves focus. Nothing is taken from the shell.

    [:octicons-arrow-right-24: Tabs & panes](guide/tabs-and-panes.md)

-   :material-transit-connection-variant: **Jump hosts and proxy commands**

    ---

    Nested `ProxyJump` chains dialled hop by hop, `ProxyCommand` transports, and the same
    agent → certificate → key → keyboard-interactive → password order `ssh` uses.

    [:octicons-arrow-right-24: Connecting](guide/connecting.md)

-   :material-folder-network-outline: **SFTP and remote editing**

    ---

    An SFTP browser per SSH tab on the same transport, and Monaco editing of remote files
    with real language services. No second login.

    [:octicons-arrow-right-24: File browser](guide/files.md)

-   :material-monitor: **RDP and VNC**

    ---

    Remote desktops open as tabs beside your terminals, with NLA, certificate pinning,
    clipboard sharing and SSH gateways. Nothing extra to install.

    [:octicons-arrow-right-24: Remote desktop](guide/remote-desktop.md)

-   :material-swap-horizontal: **Persistent tunnels**

    ---

    Saved `-L`, `-R` and `-D` forwards start with one click, without a terminal. Closing a
    tab never tears down a running tunnel.

    [:octicons-arrow-right-24: Tunnels](guide/tunnels.md)

-   :material-view-dashboard-outline: **Saved workspaces**

    ---

    Save a whole layout of local shells, SSH, Telnet, serial and remote desktop sessions in
    resizable panes with tabs. Reopen it, reconnect it, or set it as your startup workspace.

    [:octicons-arrow-right-24: Workspaces](guide/workspaces.md)

-   :material-magnify: **Quick launcher**

    ---

    ++ctrl+k++ searches saved hosts, open tabs, editor files, workspaces, commands, tunnels
    and retained session history, and acts on the result.

Muxus is built by me (FloSch), in the open and in my spare time. It is free and stays free.
