# User guide

Each page covers one part of Muxus, with screenshots and the reasoning behind its
behaviour. The pages are independent and can be read in any order.

## Connect, arrange, keep

=== "Connect"

    `~/.ssh/config` is the host list. Click a host, type `user@host` in the search box, or
    press ++ctrl+k++ and search every category at once.

    ![The hosts sidebar](../assets/screenshots/sidebar.png#only-light){ .shadow }
    ![The hosts sidebar](../assets/screenshots/sidebar-dark.png#only-dark){ .shadow }

=== "Arrange"

    Split panes in any direction, move tabs between them, and zoom one pane to the whole
    window. Layout changes do not disturb a running session.

    ![Split panes](../assets/screenshots/panes.png#only-light){ .shadow }
    ![Split panes](../assets/screenshots/panes-dark.png#only-dark){ .shadow }

=== "Keep"

    Save the layout as a workspace, save recurring tunnels, and enable session history to
    retain output beyond the scrollback.
