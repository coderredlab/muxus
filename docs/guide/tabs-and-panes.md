# Tabs & panes

Panes split in any direction, tabs move between them, and layout changes do not disturb a
running session.

## Splitting

++ctrl+shift+left++ / ++ctrl+shift+right++ / ++ctrl+shift+up++ / ++ctrl+shift+down++ splits
the focused pane toward that side. The new pane **continues the current session**: the SSH
connection is reused, so there is no second login and no second 2FA prompt. This is
configurable in [Settings → Keyboard](settings.md#keyboard); with it off, the new pane asks
what to start. Serial consoles always ask, because a serial port supports one reader.

++alt+shift+equal++ and ++alt+shift+minus++ are alternative chords for the two most common
splits, and the tab strip has split buttons for the mouse.

## Moving around

| Chord | What happens |
| --- | --- |
| ++alt+left++ / ++alt+right++ / ++alt+up++ / ++alt+down++ | Focus the pane in that direction, geometrically |
| ++ctrl+shift+o++ | Focus the next pane |
| ++alt+shift+left++ … | Send the current tab to the neighbouring pane, splitting one off when there is none |
| ++ctrl+shift+z++ | Zoom the focused pane to the whole canvas, and back |
| ++ctrl+shift+period++ / ++ctrl+shift+comma++ | Grow / shrink the focused pane |
| ++ctrl+shift+x++ | Close the pane |

!!! tip "Focus keys fall through to the shell"

    ++alt+left++ moves focus **only when a pane sits to the left**. When there is none, the
    key is passed to the shell, so ++alt+left++ still moves a word in readline.

Drag a divider to resize it, double-click it to even the split, or give it focus and use
the arrows. **Even out panes** in the pane menu balances the whole layout.

## Tabs

Each pane has a browser-style tab strip. A tab is one session: local shell, SSH, Telnet,
serial, a remote desktop, or a remote editor.

- **New tab**: ++ctrl+shift+t++, or the **+** in the strip.
- **Close**: ++ctrl+shift+w++ (++cmd+w++ on macOS). Not ++ctrl+w++, which deletes a word in
  the shell.
- **Switch**: hold ++alt++ to reveal each tab's window-wide number, then use ++alt+1++ …
  ++alt+9++ to activate that exact tab wherever it lives. **Settings → Keyboard** can keep
  the numbers visible all the time. ++ctrl+pgup++ / ++ctrl+pgdn++ still cycle within the
  focused pane.
- **Reorder or move**: ++ctrl+shift+pgup++ / ++ctrl+shift+pgdn++ reorders in the current
  strip. Drag a tab to an exact position in this strip, another split, or another Muxus
  window. A cross-window drop hands off the live terminal and restores its scrollback.
- **Pin**: choose **Pin tab** from the right-click menu. Pinned tabs stay at the left of the
  strip, keep their own drag order, and are preserved by **Close other tabs**.
- **Rename**: double-click the title.
- **Duplicate**: ++ctrl+shift+d++ opens a second session on the same host.
- **Colour flags**: assigned from the right-click menu.
- **Open in new window**: opens the same profile as a fresh session in its own window.

Each tab shows a status dot: amber while connecting, green when connected, red when the
transport is gone.

Tab numbers follow depth-first split-tree order: at every split the left or top branch comes
before the right or bottom branch, then tabs are numbered left-to-right inside each strip.
Splitting, moving, reordering or closing tabs and panes recalculates the sequence immediately.
Every tab displays its sequential number; the first nine have default single-digit shortcuts.

## Interaction between panes and tabs

- Closing the **last tab of a split pane** closes the pane.
- Moving a tab toward a direction where **no pane exists** splits one off.
- Layout changes never remount a terminal, so the shell, scrollback and SSH channel survive
  every split, close and move.
- Dragging a connected tab between **Muxus windows** transfers ownership of its running
  backend session; it does not start a second login.
- Keystrokes typed into a pane that is **still connecting** are delivered once it is ready.

## Default chord selection

Muxus takes as few keys from the shell as possible:

- ++ctrl+w++ deletes a word, and ++ctrl+2++ … ++ctrl+8++ send their control characters.
  Closing is therefore ++ctrl+shift+w++, and window-wide tab selection uses
  ++alt+1++ … ++alt+9++.
- Chords follow the **character printed on the key cap**, so ++ctrl+shift+z++ is the key
  labelled `Z` on QWERTZ and AZERTY. Arrows and keys whose character a modifier mangles use
  their physical position.
- ++ctrl+plus++ / ++ctrl+minus++ / ++ctrl+0++ zoom the **terminal font** only. The interface
  scale is a [preference](settings.md) rather than a chord.

All commands share one keymap. Search it in the [quick launcher](quick-launcher.md), or
review and rebind it in the keyboard sheet (++ctrl+shift+slash++).
