# Connecting

Muxus dials the way `ssh` does. This page describes what happens between selecting a host
and reaching a prompt.

## Resolution

Every connection starts by resolving the host through the OpenSSH configuration: a
sequential, first-obtained-wins lookup across every matching `Host` pattern, wildcards and
negations included, and every `Include`d file, accumulating `IdentityFile`,
`CertificateFile` and the `*Forward` directives. **Each hop resolves independently**, so a
jump host uses its own key and its own user.

`Match` blocks are not applied. Their conditions depend on runtime state Muxus does not
reproduce, so the options inside them are skipped.

## Host keys

Before authentication, the server's key is checked against `~/.ssh/known_hosts` and the
read-only `/etc/ssh/ssh_known_hosts`, hashed entries included.

- **Unknown host**: the fingerprint is shown for confirmation. Accepting appends the key to
  `~/.ssh/known_hosts`, so `ssh` on the command line trusts it as well.
- **Changed key**: a warning is shown. Accepting performs the `ssh-keygen -R`-style
  replacement of the old entry.

!!! danger "A changed key is not routine"

    If the host was not just rebuilt, determine why the key changed before accepting.

## Authentication order

Within one connection Muxus follows the OpenSSH order and stops at the first method that
succeeds:

1. **Agent**: every identity in the host's `IdentityAgent`, falling back to
   `SSH_AUTH_SOCK` when no override is configured.
2. **Certificates**: a `CertificateFile` together with its matching `IdentityFile`.
3. **Keys**: the `IdentityFile`s in the block, or the default `~/.ssh/id_*` set.
   Passphrase-protected keys issue a prompt. `IdentitiesOnly yes` is honoured.
4. **Keyboard-interactive**: 2FA codes, challenge/response.
5. **Password**, with retries.

Agent approval time does not consume `ConnectTimeout`. If an agent accepts a request but
never answers, Muxus shows what it is waiting for and moves to the next authentication
method after a bounded wait. The host editor's **Specific key file** mode writes
`IdentitiesOnly yes` and therefore skips the login agent entirely.

An SSH password prompt offers **Remember this password**. A single hidden
keyboard-interactive field explicitly labelled as a password offers it too, for network
devices that use keyboard-interactive for password login. The password is saved only
after authentication succeeds. The first save creates a vault and asks for a master
password of at least eight characters. By default, the vault key is kept in the OS
credential store, so routine SSH use does not prompt for the master password. In
**Settings → Passwords**, the policy can instead ask once when Muxus starts or whenever a
saved credential is needed. The master password is always required to view or edit saved
values.

If a never-prompt vault is restored without its OS credential-store entry, the next saved
password use asks for the master password and attempts to restore automatic access. The
credential can still be used for that connection if the OS store remains unavailable;
the prompt policy can also be changed or the vault reset. Private-key passphrases, 2FA
codes and all other keyboard-interactive answers remain transient and are never
remembered. See the [security model](../reference/security.md#password-vault).

## Jump chains and ProxyCommand

`ProxyJump` chains, including nested and comma-separated ones, are dialled **hop by hop**,
each with its own resolution, host-key check and authentication. Cycles are detected and
rejected.

`ProxyCommand` is supported as a transport. Muxus runs the command and speaks SSH over its
stdin/stdout, which supports tools such as `cloudflared access ssh` and corporate
`ProxyCommand` wrappers.

Forwards declared on the block (`LocalForward`, `RemoteForward`, `DynamicForward`) start
with the session, and `ForwardAgent` applies when an agent is present.

## One connection per host

Connections are multiplexed, the way OpenSSH `ControlMaster` sharing works. When a session's
resolved dial plan matches a live connection, it opens a new channel instead of a new TCP
connection. The comparison covers every hop's user, host, port and agent-forwarding policy,
plus any expanded `ProxyCommand`. Splitting a pane, opening a second tab on the same host,
the file browser, the remote editor, tunnels and ad-hoc forwards all share one SSH
transport:

- no second login and no second 2FA prompt;
- servers that cap connections per user (`MaxStartups`, firewall rules) see one connection,
  no matter how many panes are open;
- sessions started together, such as a restored workspace, collapse into a single dial with
  a single authentication round-trip.

Sharing is safe by construction: a connection whose keepalives have gone quiet is not
reused, and if the server refuses another channel on a shared connection (`MaxSessions`),
Muxus silently dials a dedicated connection for that pane instead.

Each consumer holds its own lease on the transport:

- closing one tab does not affect the others; the connection closes with its last consumer;
- a [tunnel](tunnels.md) holds its own lease, so closing every terminal leaves it running.

## Connection loss

Muxus sends an SSH keepalive after 30 idle seconds by default. Settings → Behavior changes
that fallback interval, while an explicit `ServerAliveInterval` in the matching OpenSSH
configuration takes precedence:

| Tab icon | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| :material-circle:{ style="color:#e7b341" } amber | Existing keepalives are unanswered |
| :material-circle:{ style="color:#f87171" } red | SSH declared the transport lost; the reason is printed in the terminal |

With **Automatically reconnect remote sessions** enabled, a dropped connection is retried
a few times before waiting for a key press. You can also use **Reconnect** from the tab
menu. SSH tabs additionally offer **Reconnect + tmux** and **Reconnect + screen**, which
dial a fresh transport and then reattach the existing multiplexer session.

**Force reconnect (new connection)** in the tab menu replaces one tab's connection, even
while the session is live. It never multiplexes onto an established transport, so it also
recovers an ended SSH tab whose shared connection went dead while other tabs still hold
it. Once the replacement is up, new sessions to that host use it instead of the old
transport.

The [workspace](workspaces.md) dialog reconnects selected ended sessions, all ended
sessions, or force-reconnects every remote tab. Force reconnect ends live shells; use tmux
or screen when remote programs must survive. Saved tunnels keep their existing
connections: the replaced transport carries them until they stop, while new sessions and
new tunnels use the replacement.
