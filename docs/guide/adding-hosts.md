# Adding & editing hosts

The SSH editor lets you choose where a new host lives:

- **Muxus app data only** keeps a self-contained SSH profile in the local database and
  does not change `~/.ssh/config`.
- **OpenSSH config** writes a standard `Host` block that also works with `ssh`, `scp`
  and `rsync` outside Muxus.

Presentation attributes such as folder, colour, highlighting and logging policy always
live in the Muxus database.

Open the editor with **+** at the top of the sidebar, from a host's **Edit host** menu
entry, or by pressing ++enter++ on a search that matched nothing.

!!! info "What a save rewrites"

    This applies only to hosts stored in OpenSSH config. Saving rewrites **only that block**.
    Comments, ordering, `Match` blocks and every other
    host in the file are left untouched. The write is atomic, and the previous contents are
    kept next to it as `<file>.muxus.bak`.

## General

| Field | Writes |
| --- | --- |
| **Save host in** | Selects Muxus app data or an OpenSSH configuration file for a new SSH host. |
| **Alias** | The `Host` line. Several aliases separated by spaces are accepted; the first one names the session. |
| **HostName** | `HostName`. Empty means the alias is used as the hostname, as in OpenSSH. |
| **Port** | `Port`, omitted when it is 22. |
| **User** | `User`, omitted to use the local username. |
| **Description** | A `#` comment above the block, shown in the sidebar's hover card. |
| **Config file** | Which file the block lands in: the main config, an existing `Include`d file, or a new group file that Muxus creates and includes. |
| **Display name**, **folder**, **colour** | Muxus's own database, not the configuration file. |

## Authentication

Three modes, matching OpenSSH behaviour:

- **Agent & default keys** uses the OpenSSH order: agent first, then `~/.ssh/id_*`. Writes
  nothing, since this is the default.
- **Specific key file** writes `IdentityFile` and `IdentitiesOnly yes`, so login uses only
  the selected files and never waits on the agent. The picker lists the keys found in
  `~/.ssh` with their type and comment, badges the ones **loaded in the agent**, and marks
  the ones that are **passphrase-protected**.
- **Password / interactive** writes `PubkeyAuthentication no`, so public keys are skipped
  and a prompt is issued on connect.

**User certificates** can be added separately as `CertificateFile`, for CA-signed keys.

## Connection route

The route determines how the connection is dialled.

  <figcaption>Direct, through a chain of jump hosts, or through a command that provides the transport.</figcaption>
</figure>

- **Direct** writes nothing.
- **Jump hosts** writes the chain, in order, as `ProxyJump a,b,c`. Each hop is either an
  alias from the configuration or a bare `user@host:port`. Muxus dials the hops in sequence
  and rejects a chain that loops back on itself.
- **ProxyCommand** takes a command that provides the transport on stdin/stdout, such as
  `cloudflared access ssh --hostname %h`. The `%h`, `%p` and `%r` tokens are expanded at
  dial time.

## Port forwarding

The **Forwarding** section holds the host's [X11 forwarding](x11.md) choice and its port
forwards. Forwards declared here are written into the block as `LocalForward`,
`RemoteForward` or `DynamicForward`, and start with every session to this host.

  ![Port forwarding with the live tunnel diagram](../assets/screenshots/host-editor-forwards-dark.png#only-dark){ .shadow }
  <figcaption>The diagram redraws as the fields change, showing the direction of the forward.</figcaption>
</figure>

To start a forward on demand instead, without opening a terminal, save it as a
[tunnel](tunnels.md).

## Session logging & highlighting

Two per-host overrides of the global [settings](settings.md):

- **Session logging** inherits the global policy, or forces retention on or off for this
  host, including whether keystrokes are recorded.
- **Highlighting** assigns a reusable profile, such as the built-in Nokia SR OS or SR Linux
  profile, and adds keyword or regex rules for this host's terminals, either in addition to
  or instead of the global rules.

## Advanced

Muxus does not request SFTP unless its initial probe identifies a supported Unix shell. If a
console server disconnects when it sees even that probe, Muxus reconnects once in plain-console
mode and remembers the compatibility choice until the app restarts. No manual setting is required
for the session to connect.

For known-sensitive SSH console servers and network appliances, **Enable console compatibility
mode** skips the initial probe as well, and stops sending `SendEnv`/`SetEnv` values that these
devices have no environment for. This persistent override avoids the first reconnect entirely.
Terminal allocation follows the host's TTY setting either way: Muxus asks for a terminal and
continues without one when the device rejects `pty-req`. The file-browser controls are unavailable
for plain-console sessions.

For an otherwise normal SSH server that only lacks SFTP or cannot use Muxus shell integration,
**Disable SFTP and shell integration only** keeps environment requests and normal terminal
allocation intact. This remains separate from console compatibility so existing disabled-SFTP
hosts keep their previous session behavior.

Any other keyword OpenSSH understands is entered here as free-form option/value pairs. The
panel shows the **exact block** that will be written.

## Saving

The footer offers **Save** and **Save & connect**. The second persists the selected storage
type and opens a session immediately.

Duplicating a host keeps its storage type. Deleting an OpenSSH host removes only its block;
deleting a Muxus-only host removes only its database profile.
